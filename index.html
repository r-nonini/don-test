        <p>Class, racial, and gender inequalities in Malaysia and the United States; critical urban anthropology; the anthropology of the state; political ecology, critical food studies; Chinese in Southeast Asia; the southern U.S.; China.</p>

        <p>Reed College, B.A., Philosophy, 1968; M.A., Anthropology, San Francisco State University, 1972; Ph.D., Anthropology, Stanford University, 1983.</p>
        <h4>Research Background</h4>
        <p>Fieldwork and Historical Research: Penang state, West Malaysia, 1978-1980, 1985 and summers 1990-1992, 1997, 2002, 2007; Australia, 2000, 2003; Netherlands, 2016; North Carolina, U.S., 1997-2006, 2009-2023.</p>
        <h4>Professional Focus</h4>
        <p>Throughout my career, I have examined the various forms of power that structure and harm the lives of vulnerable people and ecosystems in the cities of the modern world.  Class exploitation, racialized expropriation and gender oppression are forms of intertwined power exercised by contemporary capitalism and contemporary nation-states associated with environmental destruction. In my previous research and publications, I have examined these forms of power and the arenas in which they operate as they apply to ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia, and to whites, African Americans and other people of color in the United States and in western Europe. (see Vitae.)   I have also written about the politics of the party-state and capitalism in the Peoples Republic of China.   I am particularly interested in the social movements and activism through which those most affected by capitalist and racial domination have sought to not only resist it, but also to bring about new material (on-the-ground) realities of flourishing.</p>
        <h4>Present Research</h4>
        <p>My current research program has two foci as part of this commitment. First, my new book, co-authored with the late Dorothy Holland, Food Activism Today: Sustainability, Climate Change and Social Justice (New York University Press) is currently in press.  In it, we examine local food activism around food insecurity and sustainable farming in four different locales in North Carolina (Charlotte, Durham, Edgecombe county, and Watauga/Ashe counties). We found that local food activists we consulted faced a key predicament: poor people and people of color were often food insecure and could not afford to buy or eat the fresh and nutritious foods that local farmers grew and sold at farmers markets – yet many farmers could not make an adequate living from their farming.   We found only a few exceptional activists able to “solve” this predicament.  We discovered how they managed to do so, as well as examined its causes in the U.S.-based racialized corporate and state order.</p>
